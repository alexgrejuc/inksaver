# inksaver
Scans an image file and reduces the amount of black pixels to save on ink usage when printing. 

A spur of the moment idea that I unfortunately have not had time to refine. Currently very slow, only scans one image at a time, and has not been tested against a large set of images. 

An example of the effect can be seen with the unprocessed image "page.png" and the processed image "new_page.png"
